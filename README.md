Core game loop (lore):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revolution! Revelution and civil war has been a constant plague to the kingdom for years now.

"If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
-Mark 3:25

Outside forces are threatening to invade the land and take it entirely for themselves.

If you don't work together to establish order and banquish corruption in the kingdom, the invading forces will take over.

Core game loop (gameplay):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The leader is picked based on who started the server/kingdom.

Goal
A good leader works together with the people to establish stability and control within the Kingdom to make *everyone* prosperous.
A bad leader works together with his posse to esablish control to make *himself* prosperous.


Win condition (*out of the scope of the MVP*):
Earn yourself a statue in the Hall of Fame

How to meet that win-condition
Good Leader: Stay above a certain approval rating for a certain amount of time.
Corrupt leader: Stay in power below a certain approval rating for a certain amount of time, AND have enough money to purchase yourself a place in the Hall of Fame (which would take a *lot* of money).

Merchant: Have enough money to purchase yourself a place in the Hall of Fame (merchant section)

Other:
Have a good leader (who's already in the hall of fame) put you in the honorable mentions section of the Hall of Fame
