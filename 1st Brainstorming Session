These were our thoughts and ideas while we were coming up with the game idea while playing GRG in Roblox:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas we want to include in the game features

Being able to hide out on your own, if you want to.
(Jaclyn)

Realistic, yet very simplified, economy. 
(John)

No overly-annoying noises.
(Jaclyn)

Black market 
(secretly selling guns / illegal things)


Trading - more peer to peer trading (you can give someone money - but with taxes if in city)

City is protected except under certain conditions

I do like how you can break the laws

If farmers could get paid based on market


Being able to take goods out to peasants
(smugglers)





- The landlord situation is kind of dumb

Being able to own shops would be cool.



- Leader would set the type of government

- Each position could have a different wage

- You could choose to have guards get a base wage or 

leader should be able to pardon people


More stable government cycles would be nice


- Rice prices should be based on food prices - maybe a market where the store owner can negotiate rice prices


Maybe the farmers could sell their food (when the price is high) to the food store owner

...but maybe the farmers' food would expire if they didn't sell it after a while



Law idea:
You can't trade outside the city, where there aren't taxes.


Idea:

You can create your own little house and stuff outside the town (unprotected) and potentially start your own town - building up the walls


Idea:
It would be cool if the town was less PVP intensive

	Example: The leader could set a law where weapons would be outlawed to have on you (couldnt bear arms)



In that scenario, I think guards who attack the leader would lose their guard status (yet keep their weapon) and be marked as an outlaw.

(It would really suck if you accidentally hit the leader)


Idea:
The outlaw / barbarian camp could have a board of bounties for assasins


John:
I think the food should have a variable price based on how rare it is



Long-term idea:
Lock-smithing and lock-picking
Maybe have a 3 digit "code" you set for your door, and the lock-picker would have to guess that code - maybe with some hints? 4-digit codes for the hard doors

or maybe 5 sets of 3 digits - like Skyrim
