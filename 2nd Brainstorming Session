These were our thoughts while playing the new game Boby showed us.

Prisoner - everyone has to vote on it

The bag system is cool

How everyone can use them and it promotes cooperation (or stealing)

I like how there are signs hidden around the world that give *secret* knowledge, but I'd also like for certain things just to be explained - assuming each person is brand new.


For example, I wish on the "release prisoner" button, it would say that only the king can do so.



Boats for the delivery make a lot of sense!


I like how people can cooperate, but I wish it was incentivized with economics.

Like, in this game, you can take the wheat to whoever is baking the bread, but it would be nice if the bakery would pay you for wheat too.



I also like how there's a way to get money for yourself instead of just everyone else.


...and also how only the things sold to t he boats get taxed... that makes a lot of sense - 
In this game, player to player transactions aren't taxed, but selling to the other kingdom does


...maybe one merchant ship would come at a time, and it would change every 5 minutes
... you could buy and sell raw goods to/from the merchant ship


In this game (not ours) it might be cool if you got to keep the kingdom between log-offs, but only if the leader's role was reduced.
